                            educational use. E-mail your details to us after starting your Free

                            Since we provide an extremely detailed reporting and analytics
                            tool, they require quite a bit storage space. For average use, you
                            don’t have to worry about running out of space since the
                            Personal package limits the projects you can have.

                            For some reason if you run out of space, contact us and we will
                            see what can be done about it and make sure you are not
                            generating unnecessary reports and/or analytics data.
